<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My project is a pet self-entertainment facility. This project is launched for the pet owners and their pets. The petsâ€™ owners do not have to worry about their pet lonely when they left home for work, since their pets can have fun with this pet self-entertainment facility. </p>

<h1><b>Part One:</b> Arduino UNO R3 and one sensor control two micro servo</h1>
<p>This is the original function is when the sensor detective a pet coming, it will automatic release and drop a ball to the pet.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Parts List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One Arduino UNO R3</li>
  <li>One HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</li>
  <li>One Red LED</li>
  <li>One Green LED</li>
  <li>One Half Breadboard</li>
  <li>Male to Male Wires</li>
  <li>Two Micro Servos</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Connect the sensor and make sure it works</h3>
<p>Connect the sensor and use the Arduino libraries as resource to make sure it works.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Test your sensor and led lights</h3>
<p>Copy the code (Simple Arduino and HC-SR04 Example, which was created by jsvester for arduino) to your Arduino and test the LED lights. The sensor will measure the distance, if the distance is less than or equal to 5cm the red LED lights; otherwise, the green LED light will light.</p>
